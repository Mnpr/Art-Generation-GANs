# Gated-Gan for Multi-Style Transfer

PyTorch Implementation of https://github.com/xinyuanc91/Gated-GAN <br>
The goal of this project is to translate (from lua to python) and train the model described in this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02296<br>
I use the general architecture of this repository as a baseline: https://github.com/aitorzip/PyTorch-CycleGAN<br>
and modify it to the paper's specifications. 

## Notebooks

<ul>
<li> Builder Book: Train the model
<li> Demo: Interact with most recent model using jpeg/jpg in working directory
</ul>

## Requirements

Only tested on Python 3.7

### [PyTorch & torchvision](http://pytorch.org/)

Follow the instructions in [pytorch.org](http://pytorch.org) for your current setup

### [Visdom](https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom) (training only)
